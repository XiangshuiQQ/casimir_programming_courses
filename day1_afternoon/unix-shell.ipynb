    "Most of our daily computing is done using GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) driven mainly by a mouse and, increasingly, by touch screen interfaces. Given this, why should we learn to interact with the computer using a CLI (Command Line Interface), which requires use of a keyboard and provides much less rich input and output?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are several reasons why it is useful to have a least a basic proficiency in using the shell, in the context of scientific computing:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Operating in restricted environments**\n",
    "There are computers that may not provide a GUI, for example:\n",
    "  - High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters\n",
    "  - controllers for experimental equipment (e.g. raspberry pi)\n",
    "  - web servers (e.g. when deploying your website)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Shell is an efficient environment for manipulating files and running programs**\n",
    "The shell's whole job is to make it easy to run other programs and to interact with files on the computer.\n",
    "When running programs from the shell you can provide *arguments* that will modify the program's behaviour; This is typically more difficult or impossible when running programs by clicking on icons in a file browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition the shell provides other features, such as being able to use the output of one command as the input of another, and so being able to chain simple commands together into more complex ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Writing programs that expose a CLI is very simple**\n",
    "CLI-driven programs only need to know how to accept command line \"arguments\" and how to print text to the screen.\n",
    "The operating system typically provides these mechanisms \"for free\". In Python you can access the list of arguments provided with `sys.argv` (more on this later) and can print text by using the `print` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consequence of this is that a lot of scientific software *only* provides a CLI. It is therefore important to learn how to use the shell to be able to operate this software."

    "# Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four main aims for this part of the course:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Be able to launch and ascertain the \"state\" of your shell by executing basic commands**\n",
    "This includes information such as which user you are logged in as, the directory in\n",
    "which you find yourself, and the files in the current directory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Be able to navigate the filesystem and perform basic file manipulations**\n",
    "For many people manipulating files forms the bulk of the work they will do in the shell.\n",
    "This includes copying, renaming and deleting files, as well as viewing and editing file\n",
    "contents.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### **Be able to use the shell's productivity tools**\n",
    "This includes utilizing command completion (so that you avoid excessive typing) and searching\n",
    "through the command history (to re-use commands you previously executed). This also includes\n",
    "using more advanced shell features such as piping.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Be able to find documentation for CLI programs, and use the documentation to interact with these programs**\n",
    "It is not the aim of this course to give you knowledge of any specific tools (beyond the basic ones\n",
    "that are common to essentially all shell usage). This is why it is important to be able to\n",
    "effectively find and understand documentation for CLI programs, so that you can solve problems yourself."

    "Here's what actually happens behind the scenes when we create a pipe. When a computer runs a program — any program — it creates a *process* in memory to hold the program's software and its current state. Every process has an input channel called *standard input*. (By this point, you may be surprised that the name is so memorable, but don't worry: most programmers call it `stdin`). Every process also has a default output channel called *standard output* (or `stdout`). A second output channel called *standard error* (`stderr`) also exists. This channel is typically used for error or diagnostic messages, and it allows a user to pipe the output of one program into another while still receiving error messages in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shell is actually just another program. Under normal circumstances, whatever we type on the keyboard is sent to the shell on its standard input, and whatever it produces on standard output is displayed on our screen. When we tell the shell to run a program, it creates a new process and temporarily sends whatever we type on our keyboard to that process’s standard input, and whatever the process sends to standard output to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what happens when we run `wc -l sonnet_*./txt > word_counts.txt`. The shell starts by telling the computer to create a new process to run the `wc` program. Since we've provided some filenames as arguments, `wc` reads from them instead of from standard input. And since we’ve used `>` to redirect output to a file, the shell connects the process’s standard output to that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we run `wc -l sonnet_*.txt | sort -n` instead, the shell creates two processes (one for each process in the pipe) so that `wc` and `sort` run *simultaneously*. The standard output of wc is fed directly to the standard input of sort; since there’s no redirection with `>`, `sort`'s output goes to the screen. And if we run `wc -l sonnet_*.txt | sort -n | tail`, we get three processes with data flowing from the files, through `wc` to `sort`, and from `sort` through `tail` to the screen."
